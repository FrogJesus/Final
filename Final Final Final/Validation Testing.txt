This application displays information on where to find parts in Warframe. 
The way I tested if each individual item in this application worked was by 
starting it up and doing the intended mouseover displays and seeing if the 
buttons worked. My initial test came out with some hiccups. As you can see 
with the materials input window, I had to use Placeholder text to add a new 
row because it was less work than defining a full grid on that page. Without 
the Placeholder text for the new row, even with columnspan the mouseover 
text was stretching into rows below it and moving the grids in wacky ways. I 
had similar issues with the companions and secondary buttons, but they were 
fixed in an easier way, I was putting them in different columns before instead
of rows.

After fixing that I tested everything again, no errors with any mouseover text 
and no errors with any buttons not working. 

Through the use of the mouseover text it made the material input button and 
where to find materials somewhat redundant, but overall I decided to keep 
them anyways.
